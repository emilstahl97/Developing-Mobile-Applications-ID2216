	abstract = {Sleep plays an important role in workers' lives, allowing them to relax, restore, and revitalize their bodies, minds, and emotions every 24 hours. Sleep repairs the physical body to improve and maintain general health, consolidate learning and memory, and recharge the psychological batteries to maintain emotional balance and well-being. Quality sleep is as important as nutrition or exercise in maintaining overall health. A nutritious diet provides vitamins and minerals to maintain body functions and generate adequate energy to perform daily tasks. Regular exercise keeps muscles toned, improves cardiovascular activity, and reduces stress. However, neither diet nor exercise replaces the need for sleep. With prolonged inadequate sleep, humans do not function well. They become accident prone, are less productive, and experience increased fatigue and health problems. This article discusses the importance of sleep, sleep events, health risks associated with inadequate sleep, and health care professionals' role in protecting employees and companies.},

	shorttitle = {The promise of sleep},
	abstract = {Healthful sleep has been empirically proven to be the single most important factor in predicting longevity, more influential than diet, exercise, or heredity. And yet we are a sleep-sick society, ignorant of the facts of sleep—and the price of sleep deprivation. In this book, based on decades of study on the frontiers of sleep science, the author explains what happens when we sleep, when we don't, and how we can reclaim the most powerful—and underrated—health miracle of all.  The author reveals the price we have paid for ignoring sleep: an epidemic of heart disease, 33\% of traffic-fatigue-related accidents, and immeasurable mental and psychological disadvantages. He offers a hands-on prescription for vibrant good health and longevity, including: self-tests to determine how much sleep you really need; the role of prescription and over-the-counter sleeping aids; the latest research on how sleep affects the immune system; how to combat insomnia, snoring, and jet lag; and information on sleep disorder clinics nationwide, Web sites, and more.

It is concluded that reliable measures of overall usability can only be obtained by assessing the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with which representative users carry out representative tasks in representative environments.This requires a detailed understanding of the context of use of a product. The ESPRIT MUSiC project has developed tools which can be used to measure usability in the laboratory and the field. An overview is given of the methods and tools for measuring user performance, cognitive workload, and user perceived quality.},

	abstract = {This research investigates the validity of the layout complexity metric to GUI screen design. This metric offers a simple method to gauge the complexity of the visual design of a computer screen by classifying screen objects into classes based on common dimensions and positions. However, though it has been used by other interface researchers, it is not clear that it is a valid metric for GUIs. Initial work suggests that users prefer more complex layouts rather than the simple ones suggested by guidelines. The pilot study showed that screens midway between complex and simple were the most usable. The next experiment is at the data collection stage. It uses four screens differing in complexity and a Latin-squares design to avoid experimental bias and nuisance variables. Twenty-four human participants are randomly assigned to blocks. The final experiment will attempt to gain a wider range of users with a more complex task.},
